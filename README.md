# dockerql

A read-only SQL-like interface for docker registries.

> :warning: **The project is under active development**: Be careful how you use it at this time.  

## Why

SQL-like query interfaces is still one of the easiest to understand interface to query databases. We are still missing something like that for docker registries. 
In addition, each docker implementation is a bit different in terms of its authentication, scoping, and features. dockerql provides a unified yet extendable way to access multiple types of registries. 

## Getting started

Getting started is easy and should take seconds. 

Choose your way to get started:

1. Getting started with [docker container](https://simplycoders.github.io/dockerql/run-dockerql-as-container).
1. Getting started with [local service](https://simplycoders.github.io/dockerql/run-dockerql-as-local-server).
1. Set up [access to your registries](https://simplycoders.github.io/dockerql/set-up-access-to-registries).
